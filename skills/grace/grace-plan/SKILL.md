Run the GRACE architectural planning phase.

## Prerequisites
- `docs/requirements.xml` must exist and have at least one UseCase
- `docs/technology.xml` must exist with stack decisions
- If either is missing, tell the user to run `$grace-init` first

## Architectural Principles

When designing the architecture, apply these principles:

### Contract-First Design
Every module gets a MODULE_CONTRACT before any code is written:
- PURPOSE: one sentence, what it does
- SCOPE: what operations are included
- DEPENDS: list of module dependencies
- LINKS: knowledge graph node references

### Module Taxonomy
Classify each module as one of:
- **ENTRY_POINT** — where execution begins (CLI, HTTP handler, event listener)
- **CORE_LOGIC** — business rules and domain logic
- **DATA_LAYER** — persistence, queries, caching
- **UI_COMPONENT** — user interface elements
- **UTILITY** — shared helpers, configuration, logging
- **INTEGRATION** — external service adapters

### Knowledge Graph Design
Structure `docs/knowledge-graph.xml` for maximum navigability:
- Each module gets a unique ID tag: `M-xxx NAME="..." TYPE="..."`
- Functions annotated as `fn-name`, types as `type-Name`
- CrossLinks connect dependent modules bidirectionally
- Annotations describe what each module exports

## Process

### Phase 1: Analyze Requirements
Read `docs/requirements.xml`. For each UseCase, identify:
- What modules/components are needed
- What data flows between them
- What external services or APIs are involved

### Phase 2: Design Module Architecture
Propose a module breakdown. For each module, define:
- Purpose (one sentence)
- Type: ENTRY_POINT / CORE_LOGIC / DATA_LAYER / UI_COMPONENT / UTILITY / INTEGRATION
- Dependencies on other modules
- Key interfaces (what it exposes)

Present this to the user as a structured list and **wait for approval** before proceeding.

### Phase 3: Mental Tests
Before finalizing, run "mental tests" — walk through 2-3 key user scenarios step by step:
- Which modules are involved?
- What data flows through them?
- Where could it break?
- Are there circular dependencies?

Present the walkthrough to the user. If issues are found — revise the architecture.

### Phase 4: Generate Artifacts
After user approval:

1. Update `docs/development-plan.xml` with the full module breakdown, contracts, and data flows. Use unique ID-based tags: `M-xxx` for modules, `Phase-N` for phases, `DF-xxx` for flows, `step-N` for steps, `export-name` for interface entries. See AGENTS.md "Documentation Artifacts" for full convention.
2. Update `docs/knowledge-graph.xml` with all modules (as `M-xxx` tags), their annotations (as `fn-name`, `type-Name`, etc.), and CrossLinks between them.
3. Print: "Architecture approved. Run `$grace-generate module-name` to start generating code, `$grace-execute` for sequential execution, or `$grace-multiagent-execute` for parallel-safe waves."

## Important
- Do NOT generate any code during this phase
- This phase produces ONLY planning documents
- Every architectural decision must be explicitly approved by the user

## Output Format
Always produce:
1. Module breakdown table (ID, name, type, purpose, dependencies)
2. Data flow diagrams (textual)
3. Implementation order (phased, with dependency justification)
4. Risk assessment (what could go wrong)
